# Built in Data Types
    # Data types are the types of objects used to represent data such as numbers, text, and other values

# Six different data types in Ruby
    # Numbers
    # Strings (text)
    # True, False, Nil
    # Symbols
    # Arrays
    # Hashes

# Numbers
    # Numbers are simply just numbers
    number = 123
    # Negative numbers are created by prepending a minus in front of the number
    negative_number = -123
    # Decimals are created by including the decimal
    decimal_number = 1.23
    # You can use underscores to seperate thousands places 
    thousand_number = 1_234 # ==> 1,234

# Strings
    # A string in a programming language is a text
    
    # There are a few ways to create a string in ruby
        # you can use single quotes
        'this is a string'
        # or you can double
        "this is a string too"

    # You can concatenate strings by using the addition operator
    'Hello' + 'this' + 'is' + 'a' + 'string' # ==> 'Hellothisisastring'

    # You can also use a multiplication operator to repeat a string
    'Hi' * 3 # ==> 'HiHiHi

    # Multiplying a string in ruby will repeat the string

    # Strings have built in methods
    "hello".uppercase # ==> "HELLO"

    "hello".capitalize # ==> "HELLO"

    "hello".length # ==> 5

    "hello".reverse # ==> "olleh"


# True, False, NiL
    # These are booleon data types
        # True means true

        # False means false

        # Nil represents an object of nothing
            # Every method returns something so sometimes we need to say that something is nothing
